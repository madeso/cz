title: 'Variable declaration'
summary: '`const` vs `mut` vs `let`'

- `mut` mutable variable
- `let` runtime constant
- `const` compile time constant

Bit constness work like c++

Design though:

- Compile time functions vs const-correct functions? How are they defined?
- Would it make sense to mark a function "compile time" instead of just running it compile-time?
