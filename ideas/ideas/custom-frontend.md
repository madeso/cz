Note: I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.

What if the entire compiler frontend is implmented in script and users can select the front on a file-per-file baeis:

```cpp
syntax cz;
// rest of the file uses the cz frontend
```

This would allow frontend features to develop mopre easily and probably also extend into several DSLs
