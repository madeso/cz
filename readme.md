# cz

CZ is a new programing language inspired by C. This repo contains the specification and reference implementation. The names comes from C and Z is a homeage to Dragonball Z (2 looks like Z and is the last letter and last "release").

What follows is a list of ideas, both ideas where c/c++ could be improved. None of which has been tested.

Roughly the plan is as follows (not necessarily in order):

1. Learn more langauges. In not particular order: more how types and include work in typescript.
2. Learn how zig, odin, rust and ada work in practice (aka implement at least 1 small app/game in each).
3. Implement a reference transpiler and reimplement that app and see areas where it sufferes and can be improved.
4. Evaluate if we(I) should continue on cz or switch efforts to improve the reference langauges the pain points since working on a language with someone is better than working alone.
5. Profit?
